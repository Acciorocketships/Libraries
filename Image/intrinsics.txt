iSight Intrinsics

For x up, y right, z in, where [x y 1] = K * [X Y Z]

Camera Intrinsic Matrix:
K = [ 981.7    0     384.3 ;
        0    1043.7  636.4 ;
	0      0       1   ]

Image Center:
Vertical: 384.2718 from bottom
Horizontal: 636.4234 from left

Radial Distortion:
[ 0.0977  0.0012 ]



Matlab camera calibration results in the form:
[ fv  0  cv ;
  0  fu  cu ;
  0   0   1 ]
Where v is to the right, u is down
cv is the distance of the image center from the right
cu is the distance of the image center from the top
Convert this to the form we use with the following formula:
[ fu  0  h-cu ;
  0  fv   cv  ;
  0   0    1  ]
Radial distortion stays the same
