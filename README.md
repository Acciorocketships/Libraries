# Image Stream
• Gets images as python iterators from folders, video files, and webcams <br>
• Adds marks and text to images <br>
• Shows images <br>
• Overlays masks onto images to visualize classification <br>

# Kalman Filter
• A general-purpose Kalman Filter class <br>
• Auto-fills values that are not specified <br>
• Combines readings from different sensors <br>
• If no dt is specified, it times iterations of the loop, and recalculates parameters with that dt <br>

# Network
• Easy P2P network communication <br>
• Just create the object using node=Network(port,host), then send by using node.send(data,port=otherport,host=otherhost) <br>

# Gauss / GaussND
• Implements regression functions in continuous space with gaussians <br>
• Can be added and multiplied with each other and with constants <br>
• Contains function to find local minimum for optimization tasks <br>
